  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Explain the risks</h2>
  <p>You must get the participant’s permission to carry out a mammogram on breasts with implants.</p>

  <p>There is no medical reason for people with breast implants to avoid the procedure. The benefits of early cancer detection outweigh the minor increase in risk.</p>

  <p>Explain to them that:</p>

  <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
    <li>very rarely, implants can rupture due to pressure during imaging</li>
    <li>a special imaging technique will be used to reduce the likelihood of complications</li>
    <li>implants make it harder to spot signs of cancer as can they obscure breast tissue</li>
    <li>extra images may be needed to scan enough breast tissue, slightly increasing radiation exposure</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If the participant notices any problems with their implants after the appointment, they should contact their GP.</p>

  <p>Once you’ve explained the process and the risks, ask them to read and complete your paper consent form.</p>

  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Difficulties interpreting images</h2>
  <p>Mammograms with breast implants can be less effective at detecting breast cancer because the implants can obscure some breast tissue.</p>
